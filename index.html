     <h1>About Me</h1>
     <p>I am a first-year Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) student specializing in Full Stack Development. With a strong passion for technology and problem-solving, I am committed to building a solid foundation in computer science and software development. My academic journey has introduced me to programming fundamentals, web development, and database management, and I am eager to expand my knowledge in modern frameworks and technologies.

I am highly motivated to apply my learning through hands-on projects, coding practice, and collaborative work. I enjoy exploring how different technologies integrate to create efficient, user-friendly solutions. My long-term goal is to become a skilled full stack developer capable of contributing to innovative applications that make a real impact.

Alongside academics, I value continuous learning, adaptability, and teamwork, which I believe are essential in the ever-evolving tech industry. I look forward to gaining experience, sharpening my skills, and growing as a developer through practical exposure and real-world challenges.</p>

        <h2> Skills</h2>
 <H4> I am currently skilling up in the fundamentals of web development and programming, with a primary focus on HTML and Python. Through HTML, I am learning how to structure and design web pages, gaining hands-on experience in creating simple layouts and understanding the basics of user-friendly design. Alongside this, I am exploring Python to strengthen my logical thinking and problem-solving abilities while building a strong programming foundation. As a beginner, I am committed to continuous learning and regularly practicing coding to enhance my confidence and efficiency. I am also developing essential soft skills such as adaptability, communication, and teamwork, which I believe are equally important in the technology field. With time, I aim to expand my skills into CSS, JavaScript, and advanced Python concepts, ultimately working towards becoming a competent full stack developer
